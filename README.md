# H_Accounting

Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth exploration of an accounting database, where I utilized SQL to retrieve, analyze, and process financial data. My main goal was to create Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements for a given year. To achieve this, I built a stored procedure that performs the following tasks:

Accepts a specific year as an input and calculates the net profit or loss for that year.
Uses the calculated net profit or loss to generate the B/S statement.
Demonstrates the fundamental accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
Outputs the P&L and B/S statements in a clear, understandable format.
Includes the % change compared to the previous year for every major line item on the P&L and B/S.
Provides descriptive headers for each major account line item and each section of the P&L and B/S.
Calculates and includes additional financial metrics and ratios that could be useful in analyzing a start-up company.
As an additional challenge, I also produced a Cash Flow Statement.

Throughout the SQL scripts, I have included comprehensive comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each block of code.
